# binary-tree-visualization

## summary

Draw a binary tree in the browser based on the pre-order traversal sequence (including empty leaves).

## dependencies

It should work on any modern browser.

## usage

Non-empty nodes are positive integers, and empty leaves are denoted by '#'.

For example, if you enter the following input (the first number represents the size of every non-empty node, and the second line is the traversal sequence),

> 32

> 1 2 3 # # 4 # # 5 6 7 # # 8 # # #

you will get the following result.
